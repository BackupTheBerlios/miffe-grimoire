Gallery is a web based software product that lets you 
manage your photos on your own website. You must have 
your own website with PHP support in order to install 
and use it. With Gallery you can easily create and 
maintain albums of photos via an intuitive interface. 
Photo management includes automatic thumbnail creation, 
image resizing, rotation, ordering, captioning, searching 
and more. Albums can have read, write and caption 
permissions per individual authenticated user for an 
additional level of privacy.
