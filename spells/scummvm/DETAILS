ScummVM is an implementation of LucasArts S.C.U.M.M. (Script Creation Utility
for Maniac Mansion) interpreter, used in games such as Monkey Island,
Indiana Jones, Day Of The Tentacle, Sam and Max, and many more. Some things
are still missing, and some games cannot be completeted yet. There are quite
a few known bugs. Regardless of the bugs it is still possible to play some
games all the way through to the end. Still other games do not load at all.
Keep your eye on our Compatability page to see which games function with the
current build. Comments and suggestions can be left in our forum.
