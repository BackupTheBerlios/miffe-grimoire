Insight is a powerfull GUI debuger allowing you to easely debug 
your application. it's a gdb frontend. It has easy watchpoint adding mechanism
(right clik and select add, or select whole expression and right click then add)
debugging can be done in source mode, assembler mod or a mix of both.
the only problem you can find is that's impossible to run application with args...
and source is'nt hightlighted
this is the only working front end I found (ddd doesn't compile for me anymore)
