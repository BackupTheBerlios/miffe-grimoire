awstats is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates
advanced web, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This
log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you
all possible information your log contains, in few graphical
web pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to
process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log
files from IIS (W3C log format), Apache log files (NCSA
combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar
and most of all web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail
servers (and some ftp).
