cdf is a library for the Common Data Format (CDF) created
by National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC). CDF is 
self-describing data abstraction for the storage and 
manipulation of multidimensional data in a discipline-
independent fashion. Although CDF has its own internal 
self describing format, it consists of more than just a 
data format. CDF is a scientific data management package 
(known as the "CDF Library") which allows programmers
 and application developers to manage and manipulate scalar, 
vector, and multi-dimensional data arrays. The irony of 
the term "FORMAT" is that the actual data format which 
CDF utilizes is completely transparent to the user and 
accessible through a consistent set of interface (known 
as the "CDF Interface") routines. Therefore, programmers 
are not burdened with performing low level I/Os to 
physically format and unformat the data file.
