dcraw decodes any raw image from any digital camera. All digital 
cameras made since 1997 produce JPEG images but there are some
disadvantages. JPEG is a lossy format, a lot of information is
thrown away. That's why midrange and high-end digital cameras 
offer an alternative: Raw, unprocessed CCD data files, for which
the camera manufacturer provides special decoding software and 
there is no source code. However, dcraw is free and became a 
standard tool within and outside the Open Source world.
It's small (about 3000 lines), portable (standard C libraries 
only), free, and when used skillfully, produces better quality 
output than the tools provided by the camera vendor.
