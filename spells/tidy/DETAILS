cat << EOF
tidy is a utility for fixing HTML mistakes automatically and
tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup. It also
works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated
by specialized HTML editors and conversion tools, and can 
help you identify where you need to pay further attention on
making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities.

Tidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring
to your attention things that you need to work on yourself. 
Each item found is listed with the line number and column so
that you can see where the problem lies in your markup. Tidy
won't generate a cleaned up version when there are problems
that it can't be sure of how to handle. These are logged as
"errors" rather than "warnings".
