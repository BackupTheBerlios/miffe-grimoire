stream << EOF
sonypidd monitors sonypi events and do things, on machines that have
the Sony programmable I/O device. Requires the sonypid daemon as 
input, and the spicctrl, aumix, and sox programs for output.

There is a table of actions to take for each sonypi function-key event.  
Only a few of the events (notably brightness and loudness) are used.
 
There is currently no support for anything other than function-key
events -- but it should be obvious where to add that functionality.

The external commands may need customization for your system.
