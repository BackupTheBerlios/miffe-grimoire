The GNUstep Base Library implements the FoundationKit portion of the OpenStep
specification. It has as its heritage the libobjects library; a set of
general-purpose, non-graphical Objective-C classes designed in the Smalltalk
tradition, and was written by Andrew McCallum. The library has since been
greatly enhanced by Andrew and many other contributing developers to be a
fairly complete FoundationKit implementation; it still contains the extensive
collection classes from the original libobjects library.
