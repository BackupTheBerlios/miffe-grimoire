Sketch is a vector drawing program similar to CorelDraw or 
Adobe Illustrator. It is written almost completely in 
Python with some modules written in C, combining the 
flexibility and power of Python with the speed of C. 
Advanced features include gradient fills, clip masks, 
text along a path, blend groups, convert text to curves, 
and more.
