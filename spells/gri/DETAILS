gri is a language for scientific graphics programming. 
The word "language" is important: Gri is command-driven, 
not point/click.

Some users consider Gri similar to LaTeX, since both 
provide extensive power as a reward for tolerating a 
learning curve.

Gri can make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image 
graphs, in PostScript and (someday) SVG formats. Control 
is provided over all aspects of drawing, e.g. line widths, 
colors, and fonts. A TeX-like syntax provides common 
mathematical symbols.
